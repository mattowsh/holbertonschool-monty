# Interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files
The **interpeter for Monty ByteCodes files project** is a project of Foundations: second trimester, of the career Software Engineering at Holberton School.

The objetive is **create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files** using C programming language.

The authors are Santiago Fernández and Belén Matto.

## The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension.

There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument.

## Functions and system calls used
- `wait` (man 2 wait)  MUST FIX AT THE END

## Files
- **`monty.h`** : Header File  

## Usage example
Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/mattowsh/holbertonschool-monty.git

Compile the files in the following way:

    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o monty
